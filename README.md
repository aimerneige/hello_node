# Hello Node

## About

This is some simple example when I learning nodejs.

## Let's start!

### Hello World

Just like what's in `hello.js`. If you have something like this:

```js
console.log("Hello World!");
```

Run this with below command:

```bash
node hello.js
```

You will get a output `Hello World!` on the terminal.

This is the standard IO operation on nodejs.

## Console Log

Just like what's in `consolelog.js`. The `console.log` function is like the function `printf` in C language, you can pass arguments to it.
